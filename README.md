* Contributing
    You can review code of this project if you want. I really appreciate that.

    Only thing is that this project's UI is written in Polish language (till now, it may change in the future)

    You intend reviewing this code? This is how to do it here
    1. Create separate branch with meaningful name - something like `username's code review`
    2. In comments, placed as close as is possible to code, add your suggestions (alternatively with written code)
    3. Create pull request with explanation of your changes, I'll review it and then merge it (of course if review is useful)

## That is all I think. Enjoy using this website
